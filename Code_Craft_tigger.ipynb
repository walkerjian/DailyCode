        "##Solution:\n",
        "- **Debounce Mechanism**: The `debounce` function is designed to limit how often a particular function (in this case, `onKeyPress`) can be executed. It does this by checking the time elapsed since the last successful function call.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Debounce Time**: We set the debounce time to 1000 milliseconds (1 second). This means that once `onKeyPress` is called, it cannot be called again until 1 second has passed, regardless of how many times the debounce function is invoked.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Simulated Key Press**: The `main` loop alternates between simulating a key press and pausing. This is done to demonstrate the debounce functionality clearly.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - When simulating a key press (`debounce(onKeyPress, DEBOUNCE_TIME)`), it checks if the required time interval has passed since the last call. If not, it prints \"Debounce block\".\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - The program then pauses for 2 seconds (`usleep(2000000)`), allowing enough time for the debounce interval to reset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Output**: The console will display \"Key Pressed\" when the debounce interval has elapsed and the function is successfully called, and \"Debounce block\" when subsequent calls within the interval are blocked.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Icelandic Phrase Comment**: For a touch of humor and to express the frustration one might feel during debugging, the Icelandic phrase \"Skítur og skrambi, vitið er í krambi!\" is included as a comment. This translates to \"Crap and clutter, my brain's in a gutter!\", fitting the context of troubleshooting and debugging."
