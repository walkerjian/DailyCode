        "\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Graph Representation**:\n",
        "   - We represent the flights as a graph where each city is a node and each direct flight is an edge with the flight cost as the weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Priority Queue**:\n",
        "   - We use a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the current least-cost path first. Each entry in the queue is a tuple containing the total cost to reach the current city, the current city itself, the number of stops taken so far, and the path taken so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visited Dictionary**:\n",
        "   - This dictionary keeps track of the minimum number of stops taken to reach each city. This helps in avoiding redundant work and ensuring we do not explore paths that have more stops but are not necessarily cheaper.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Stopping Condition**:\n",
        "   - If the destination city is reached, we return the total cost and the path.\n",
        "   - If the number of stops exceeds `max_connections`, we skip that path.\n",
        "   - If a city is reached with more stops than recorded in the visited dictionary, we skip exploring from that city.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Example Execution**:\n",
        "   - For the given example flights, the function correctly identifies the cheapest fare from JFK to LAX with up to 3 connections, resulting in the itinerary `JFK -> ATL -> ORD -> LAX` with a total cost of $440."
