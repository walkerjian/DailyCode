        "     1 2 3\n",

        "   - We need to define when two nodes (keys) can be directly connected without violating the rules, specifically handling cases where a key \"jumps\" over another key.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Handling \"Jumps\"**:\n",
        "   - We can define a dictionary `jumps` where for each pair of keys, if a direct move between them is not allowed without visiting an intermediary, the dictionary will map the pair to the intermediary key. For instance:\n",
        "     - $ (1, 3) \\to 2 $, $ (1, 7) \\to 4 $, $ (3, 9) \\to 6 $, $ (7, 9) \\to 8 $, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Backtracking Algorithm**:\n",
        "   - We will use a recursive function to try all possible moves from each key, adhering to the rules defined by the `jumps` dictionary and checking whether a key has been visited.\n",
        "   - We maintain a count of valid patterns that start from each key and sum them up.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Optimization Considerations**:\n",
        "   - Symmetry can be used to reduce computation. Patterns starting from 1 and 3 are symmetric to those starting from 7 and 9, and those from 2 are symmetric to those from 4, 6, and 8.\n",
        "   - We only need to compute patterns starting from a few keys and then multiply by their symmetrical counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python Implementation\n",
        "This function will calculate the number of valid unlock patterns for any given $ N $ between 1 and 9, by considering the keypad rules mentioned."
