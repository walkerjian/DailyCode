        "To generate the $k$th row of Pascal's triangle using $O(k)$ space, we can use an iterative approach. Instead of constructing the entire triangle, we'll directly compute the desired row. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step method to achieve this:\n",

        "   - For each row up to $k$, append `0` to the row. This helps in the calculation as it doesn't affect the sum when adding the previous element.\n",
        "   - Update the row from right to left. This ensures that the current value of `row[j]` is not overwritten before it is used to compute `row[j + 1]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Updating in place**:\n",
        "   - By iterating from the end of the list to the beginning, we ensure that each value is updated only after it has been used to update the subsequent value.\n",

        "Example for $k = 4$:\n",
