        "To find both the minimum and maximum values in an array using less than 2 * (N - 2) comparisons, we can implement an efficient algorithm known as the \"pairwise comparison\" method. This method effectively reduces the number of comparisons by grouping elements into pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm, followed by the implementation:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Algorithm Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pair Elements:** Process the elements in pairs. This means taking two adjacent elements at a time (i.e., elements at indices 0 and 1, 2 and 3, etc.).\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Compare Pairs:** For each pair, compare the two elements:\n",
        "   - Identify the smaller element as a candidate for the minimum.\n",
        "   - Identify the larger element as a candidate for the maximum.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Maintain Two Lists:** Keep track of all the \"minimum candidates\" in one list and all the \"maximum candidates\" in another list by comparing only within each pair.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Reduction:**\n",
        "   - Find the smallest element in the \"minimum candidates\" list.\n",
        "   - Find the largest element in the \"maximum candidates\" list.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method requires one comparison for each pair to determine the smaller and larger, plus at most \\((N/2 - 1)\\) comparisons to find the minimum from the minimum candidates and \\((N/2 - 1)\\) comparisons to find the maximum from the maximum candidates. Hence, the total number of comparisons is roughly \\(3N/2 - 2\\) if \\(N\\) is even, which is better than \\(2N - 2\\) comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Analysis:\n",
        "- This approach ensures each pair does a dual contribution to the search for the minimum and maximum, hence reducing the total number of comparisons needed.\n",
        "- This method is particularly effective when dealing with large arrays as it significantly reduces the comparison count compared to naive methods."
