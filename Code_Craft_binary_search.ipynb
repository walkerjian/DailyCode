        "To solve this problem, we can use a binary search algorithm, which operates in O(log N) time complexity. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we need to avoid multiplication, division, or bit-shift operations, we will have to slightly modify the standard binary search algorithm. Typically, binary search calculates the middle index as `(low + high) / 2`. However, to avoid division, we can use addition and subtraction to find the middle index. The middle can be computed as `low + (high - low) / 2`. This avoids direct division, but it still implicitly uses division. To completely avoid division, we can use a technique to increment `low` and decrement `high` appropriately.\n",

        "###Analysis of Execution Complexity:\n",
        "The binary search algorithm achieves its $O(log N)$ time complexity through its process of repeatedly halving the search space. Here's a breakdown of how this is accomplished:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initial Search Space**: Initially, the search space includes the entire array, which has N elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Halving the Search Space**: At each step, binary search divides the search space in half. It does this by finding the middle element of the current search space and comparing it to the target element `x`. If the middle element is equal to `x`, the search is successful. If `x` is smaller, the search continues in the left half; if `x` is larger, it continues in the right half.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Logarithmic Reduction**: This halving of the search space happens at each step. After the first step, the search space size is N/2, after the second step it's N/4, then N/8, and so on. This exponential reduction in size leads to the logarithmic time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Number of Steps**: The number of steps needed to reduce the search space from N to 1 (where the element is either found or the search space is exhausted) is $log₂N$. This is because we're dividing the search space in half at each step. The base-2 logarithm of $N (log₂N)$ gives us the number of times we can divide N by 2 before we reach 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Efficiency**: Due to this logarithmic reduction, binary search is highly efficient for large arrays. For example, for an array of 1024 elements, binary search would need, at most, about 10 comparisons (since 2¹⁰ = 1024), as opposed to a linear search, which might need up to 1024 comparisons in the worst case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, the $O(log N)$ time complexity of the binary search algorithm is a direct result of this logarithmic reduction in the size of the search space at each step of the algorithm."
