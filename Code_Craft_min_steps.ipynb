        "The logic of the solution for calculating the minimum number of steps required to move through a sequence of points on a 2D grid is as follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Movement**:\n",
        "    - In this grid, you can move in any of the 8 directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals.\n",
        "    - A key observation is that moving diagonally (like from `(x, y)` to `(x+1, y+1)`) counts as a single step, just like moving horizontally or vertically.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Calculating Steps Between Two Points**:\n",
        "    - The minimum number of steps required to move from one point to another is the greater of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.\n",
        "    - For example, to move from `(2, 3)` to `(5, 6)`, the x-coordinate difference is `3` (from 2 to 5) and the y-coordinate difference is `3` (from 3 to 6). Since these differences are equal, the minimum steps required are `3`, moving diagonally.\n",
        "    - If the differences were not equal, like moving from `(2, 3)` to `(5, 7)`, the minimum steps would be the greater of the two differences, which in this case is `4` (from 3 to 7).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Applying the Logic to a Sequence of Points**:\n",
        "    - The solution iterates through the given sequence of points.\n",
        "    - For each pair of consecutive points, it calculates the minimum steps required to move from one to the next using the method described above.\n",
        "    - These steps are then summed up to get the total minimum number of steps to cover all points in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Edge Cases**:\n",
        "    - If the list of points is empty, the function returns `0` since there are no steps to be taken.\n",
        "    - Similarly, if there is only one point or if consecutive points are identical, the steps required are `0`."
