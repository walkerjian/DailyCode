        "\n",
        "In addition, the lock has a certain number of \"dead ends\", meaning that if you turn the wheels to one of these combinations, the lock becomes stuck in that state and cannot be opened.\n",

        "Let us consider a \"move\" to be a rotation of a single wheel by one digit, in either direction. Given a lock initially set to 000, a target combination, and a list of dead ends, write a function that returns the minimum number of moves required to reach the target state, or None if this is impossible.\n"

        "To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, where each state of the lock is represented by a node in the graph. The edges between nodes represent a single move of one of the wheels. Here's how we can approach the problem:\n",

        "1. Start from the initial state '000'.\n",
        "2. Generate all possible states from the current state by incrementing or decrementing each of the three wheels.\n",
        "3. For each generated state, if it's not a dead end and has not been visited yet, add it to the queue for further exploration.\n",
        "4. Count each step taken as a move.\n",
        "5. Continue the process until the target state is reached or no more states are available for exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the queue is exhausted and the target state has not been reached, then it's impossible to unlock, and we should return `None`. Otherwise, we return the number of moves taken to reach the target state.\n"
