        "The skyline of a city is composed of several buildings of various widths and heights, possibly overlapping one another when viewed from a distance. We can represent the buildings using an array of (left, right, height) tuples, which tell us where on an imaginary x-axis a building begins and ends, and how tall it is. The skyline itself can be described by a list of (x, height) tuples, giving the locations at which the height visible to a distant observer changes, and each new height.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given an array of buildings as described above, create a function that returns the skyline.\n",

        "For example, suppose the input consists of the buildings [(0, 15, 3), (4, 11, 5), (19, 23, 4)]. In aggregate, these buildings would create a skyline that looks like the one below.\n",

        "##Solution:\n",
        "To solve this problem, we can follow a multi-step approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Split and Transform Building Tuples:** Break down each building's tuple `(left, right, height)` into two events: one for the start of the building and one for the end. For the start, we can use `(left, -height)` to signify an increase in height at `left`, and for the end, we use `(right, height)` to signify a decrease in height at `right`. The negative height for the start helps us recognize that it's a starting edge.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sort Events:** Sort all the events (both starting and ending points for all buildings) based on their x-coordinate. In case of a tie, sort by height. This way, we process starts of buildings before ends if they are at the same x-coordinate.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Process Events to Create Skyline:** We'll process each event in sorted order. For starting points, add the height to a data structure that allows us to know the current highest building at any point. For ending points, remove the building height. Whenever there's a change in the highest building, it becomes a part of the skyline.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Output the Skyline:** Each time we find a change in the highest building height, we output the x-coordinate of the change along with the new height.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the data structure to keep track of the current highest building, a max-heap is suitable because it allows us to efficiently find and remove the maximum element.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Implementation:\n",
        "Let's implement this in Python."
