        "To solve this problem, we need to determine a way to split the array \\( N \\) into \\( k \\) partitions such that the maximum sum of these partitions is minimized. A good approach to achieve this is by using binary search combined with a greedy check. Here are the detailed steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define the Binary Search Range:**\n",
        "   - The lower bound (`low`) can be set to the maximum element in the array \\( N \\), because no partition can have a sum less than the largest element.\n",
        "   - The upper bound (`high`) can be set to the sum of all elements in the array \\( N \\), as this is the maximum possible sum for a partition if all elements were in a single partition.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Binary Search to Find the Optimal Maximum Partition Sum:**\n",
        "   - For a middle value `mid` in our current range, check if it is possible to partition the array such that no partition exceeds the sum `mid`.\n",
        "   - Use a greedy approach to check feasibility: Iterate through the array and create partitions such that the sum of the elements in each partition does not exceed `mid`. If more than \\( k \\) partitions are needed, then `mid` is too small.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adjust Binary Search Bounds Based on Feasibility:**\n",
        "   - If it is possible to partition the array with sum `mid` into \\( k \\) or fewer partitions, then try a smaller `mid` (i.e., move `high` to `mid - 1`).\n",
        "   - If it is not possible, then increase `mid` (i.e., move `low` to `mid + 1`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Return the Result:**\n",
        "   - The `low` value after the end of the binary search will be the minimum maximum partition sum.\n",
        "\n",
        "This function should correctly output `8` for the example given. The partitions will be [5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4] which minimizes the maximum sum of the partitions."
