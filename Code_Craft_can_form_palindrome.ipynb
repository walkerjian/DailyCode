        "To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to check whether we can transform the given string into a palindrome by removing at most \\( k \\) characters. The key insight is to use a helper function that determines the minimum number of deletions required to turn a substring into a palindrome.\n",

        "1. **Base Case:** If the string is already a palindrome or has a length of 0 or 1, we don't need to delete any characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Recursive Case:** We check two cases:\n",
        "   - If the first and last characters of the string are the same, we recursively check the substring excluding these two characters.\n",
        "   - If they are different, we need to consider removing one of them. We take the minimum number of deletions required when removing the first character or the last character and add 1 (since we are deleting one character).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. We compare the minimum number of deletions required to make the string a palindrome with \\( k \\). If it's less than or equal to \\( k \\), we return `True`, else `False`.\n"
