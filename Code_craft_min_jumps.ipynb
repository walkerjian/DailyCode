        "Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - `jumps` keeps track of the number of jumps needed to reach the end.\n",
        "   - `current_end` is the farthest index that can be reached with the current number of jumps.\n",
        "   - `farthest` is the farthest index that can be reached with the next jump.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterate through the array**:\n",
        "   - For each position `i`, update `farthest` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + arr[i]` (the farthest index that can be reached from `i`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Check if we need to jump**:\n",
        "   - If we reach `current_end`, it means we need to make a jump, so increment the `jumps` counter and update `current_end` to `farthest`.\n",
        "   - If `current_end` is greater than or equal to the last index of the array, we break the loop as we have reached or exceeded the end of the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Return the number of jumps**:\n",
        "   - The function returns the total number of jumps required to reach the end of the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "This greedy algorithm ensures that we always make the optimal jump to reach the end of the array with the minimum number of jumps."
