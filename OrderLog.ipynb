This allows for efficient \"rolling\" insertions and retrievals. The idea is to maintain a fixed-size array of size \\( N \\) and a pointer to the last inserted position. Every time we record a new order, we move the pointer one position forward (wrapping around if necessary) and overwrite the previous value."

        "The optimization flags successfully reduced the size of the binary, which can be beneficial, especially if disk space or distribution size is a concern. In terms of execution time, the differences are minimal for this particular program, likely because the operations performed by the program are already quite simple and fast. The minor variations in `user` and `sys` times are within the margins of error for such short-running programs.\n",
