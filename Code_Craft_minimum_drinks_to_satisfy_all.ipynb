        "3. **Algorithm:** The Set Cover problem is NP-complete, meaning there is no known polynomial-time solution that solves all instances optimally. However, a common approach is to use a greedy algorithm:\n",
        "   - Repeatedly select the drink that covers the most uncovered customers until all are covered.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Implementation Steps:**\n",
