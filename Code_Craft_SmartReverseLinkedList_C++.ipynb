        "To reverse a singly linked list in-place, we need to modify the next pointers of each node so that they point to the previous node instead of the next node. We'll use three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next` to keep track of the nodes while we traverse and reverse the list. Here's a step-by-step algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialize three pointers: `prev` as `null`, `curr` as the head of the list, and `next` as `null`.\n",
        "2. Traverse the list. For each node:\n",
        "   - Save the next node (`next = curr.next`).\n",
        "   - Reverse the current node's pointer (`curr.next = prev`).\n",
        "   - Move `prev` and `curr` one step forward (`prev = curr`, `curr = next`).\n",
        "3. Once the traversal is complete, `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list.\n",

        "3. **Rule of Three/Five**: Given that we are using `unique_ptr`, the default copy constructor and assignment operator provided by the compiler would be deleted. However, in this context, it's not necessary to define custom ones, as `ListNode` instances are not meant to be copied or assigned.\n",

        "In this version, `unique_ptr` manages the memory of `ListNode` objects. When a `unique_ptr` goes out of scope or is reassigned, the memory it owns is automatically released. This makes our code safer and easier to maintain, as we no longer need to worry about manually deleting `ListNode` objects. The use of `move` semantics is crucial here, as `unique_ptr` does not allow copying, only moving, which transfers ownership of the managed object.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Understanding Raw Pointers\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Basics**: In C++, a raw pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. They are powerful but require careful management.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Memory Management**: The primary challenge with raw pointers is manual memory management. You must explicitly allocate and deallocate memory using `new` and `delete`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dangling Pointers**: These occur when a memory address is referenced after it has been freed. This can lead to undefined behavior and difficult-to-track bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memory Leaks**: Forgetting to free memory allocated with `new` results in memory leaks, where memory is consumed but not available for use.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Ownership and Lifetimes**: Raw pointers don't inherently convey ownership semantics, making it unclear whether a pointer is responsible for deallocating the memory it points to.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction to Smart Pointers\n",
        "\n",
        "Smart pointers are a part of the C++ Standard Library that manage memory automatically. They help prevent memory leaks and make code safer and more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Smart Pointers\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **std::unique_ptr**:\n",
        "   - Provides exclusive ownership of the memory.\n",
        "   - Memory is automatically released when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope.\n",
        "   - Cannot be copied, ensuring single ownership, but can be moved using move semantics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **std::shared_ptr**:\n",
        "   - Allows multiple pointers to own a single resource.\n",
        "   - Uses reference counting to track how many `shared_ptr`s point to the same memory. The memory is freed when the last `shared_ptr` is destroyed or reset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **std::weak_ptr**:\n",
        "   - Complements `shared_ptr` by providing a non-owning \"weak\" reference.\n",
        "   - Does not increase the reference count of `shared_ptr`.\n",
        "   - Useful for breaking reference cycles which can lead to memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Transitioning from Raw to Smart Pointers\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Automatic Memory Management**: Smart pointers automatically manage memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks and dangling pointers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Ownership Semantics**: They make ownership and lifetime management of dynamic objects more explicit and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Avoiding Common Pitfalls**:\n",
        "   - With smart pointers, many common issues like double deletion, memory leaks, and dangling pointers are greatly mitigated.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Performance Considerations**: While smart pointers introduce some overhead (like reference counting in `shared_ptr`), they provide significant safety benefits. Modern C++ compilers are also quite efficient at optimizing smart pointer usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Prefer Smart Pointers**: Favor `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr` over raw pointers for dynamic memory allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Use Raw Pointers for Non-owning References**: When you need a pointer that does not imply ownership, raw pointers or `weak_ptr` are appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Be Cautious with Cycles**: Be wary of reference cycles with `shared_ptr`, which can lead to memory leaks. Use `weak_ptr` to break cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Interoperability with Legacy Code**: When interfacing with legacy C++ code or C libraries, you might still need to use raw pointers. Wrap these as soon as possible in smart pointers."
