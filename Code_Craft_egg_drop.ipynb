        "The problem described is known as the **Egg Drop Problem**, a classic exercise in dynamic programming and optimization. To solve this problem efficiently, especially for a large number of floors $ k $ and multiple eggs $ N $, it's crucial to minimize the maximum number of drops in the worst-case scenario. The approach can be outlined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **When you have one egg (N = 1)**: The strategy is straightforward â€” start from the first floor and go up one floor at a time until the egg breaks. The worst-case number of drops is $ k $.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **When you have more than one egg**: The strategy involves determining a floor from which to drop an egg such that the number of additional drops required is minimized, considering both scenarios:\n",
        "   - If the egg breaks, you will need to test all the floors below this floor using one fewer egg.\n",
        "   - If the egg does not break, you will test the floors above this floor with the same number of eggs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The recursive relationship to determine the minimum number of drops $ m(N, k) $ can be expressed as:\n",
        "$ m(N, k) = 1 + \\min_{x=1}^{k} \\left( \\max(m(N-1, x-1), m(N, k-x)) \\right) $\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $ m(N-1, x-1) $ is the worst-case scenario if the egg breaks.\n",
        "- $ m(N, k-x) $ is the worst-case scenario if the egg doesn't break.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a Python implementation of the solution using dynamic programming. This implementation uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum number of drops required. Additionally, it employs a binary search within the inner loop to optimize the search for the floor to test, reducing the time complexity from $ O(k^2 \\cdot N) $ in a simple dynamic programming approach to approximately $ O(k \\cdot N \\cdot \\log k) $ due to the binary search."
