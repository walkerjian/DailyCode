        "To determine the denominations that must be in use based on an array where each element $ i $ represents the number of ways we can produce $ i $ units of change, we can follow a deductive approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Starting Point**: Start with the understanding that you can make 0 units of change in exactly one way, i.e., by using no coins at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Identify Non-zero Entries**: For every non-zero entry at index $ i $ in the array, if the number of ways to produce $ i $ units of change is greater than what could be achieved with the already identified denominations, then $ i $ itself must be a denomination. This is because the only way a new number of ways to make $ i $ units of change can appear is if there's a new coin of denomination $ i $.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Deduction Method**: As you identify a denomination, update the count of ways to make each amount of change by considering this new denomination. This involves a dynamic programming-like approach where for each new denomination $ d $ found, you update the array from index $ d $ to $ N $ by adding the ways to make $ i-d $ units to the count at index $ i $."
