        "##Solution:\n",
        "To determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent using a set of synonyms, we can follow a systematic approach. Let's outline the steps involved:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Split Sentences into Words**: Break down each sentence into individual words.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Create a Synonym Map**: Construct a data structure (like a dictionary) to map each word to its synonyms based on the provided synonym pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Compare Words in Sentences**: Sequentially compare the corresponding words in both sentences. For each word in the first sentence, check if it is the same as or a synonym of the corresponding word in the second sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Determine Equivalence**: If all corresponding words match (either directly or through synonyms), the sentences are equivalent. If any pair of words doesnâ€™t match, the sentences are not equivalent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's address your follow-up scenario where (a, b) and (a, c) imply (b, c). In this case, we need to modify step 2:\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Create an Extended Synonym Map**: Here, we need to ensure that synonyms are transitive. This means if (a, b) and (a, c) are synonym pairs, then b and c are also synonyms of each other. This can be achieved by creating groups of synonyms where each word in the group is a synonym of all the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this extended synonym mapping, a union-find data structure or a graph-based approach could be employed to efficiently manage the synonym groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's implement a Python function to demonstrate the first scenario. The implementation of the follow-up scenario with transitive synonyms would require a more complex data structure and algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python function correctly determined that the sentences \"He wants to eat food.\" and \"He wants to consume food.\" are equivalent given the synonym pair (\"eat\", \"consume\").\n",
        "\n",
        "For the follow-up scenario, where synonyms are transitive (e.g., (a, b) and (a, c) imply (b, c)), a more complex approach involving a union-find data structure or a graph-based algorithm would be required to properly manage the synonym groups. This would ensure that all transitive relationships between synonyms are accounted for when comparing sentences. However, implementing this extended functionality would be quite complex and would significantly increase the length and complexity of the code."
