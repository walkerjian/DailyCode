        "Implementing a stack API using only a heap requires a strategy to maintain the stack's Last In, First Out (LIFO) order using the heap's structure, which naturally follows a different order, either Min Heap (the smallest element is always on top) or Max Heap (the largest element is always on top).\n",
        "\n",
        "The core challenge is that a heap is designed to efficiently remove the smallest or largest element (depending on if it's a min-heap or max-heap), not the most recently added element. To simulate stack behavior (LIFO) with a heap, we can use timestamps or an increasing counter to keep track of the insertion order. By associating each element pushed onto the \"stack\" with an incrementing count, we can ensure that the most recently pushed item can be identified as having the highest count. Thus, by using a max-heap based on these counts, the item most recently added will always be at the top of the heap.\n",

        "Here's a Python class that implements a stack using a max heap. We'll use the heapq module, which provides an implementation of the min heap.

        "Implementing a stack using a heap in C requires manually managing the heap's memory and implementing the heap operations to maintain the stack's Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior. We'll create a max heap where each element is a struct containing the item and its insertion order (a timestamp or counter). Since C does not have a built-in heap library like Python, we'll need to implement both the heap and the stack functionalities from scratch.\n",

        "3. **Stack API Using the Heap**: Use the heap to implement the `stack_push` and `stack_pop` functions. The `order` field in the heap elements will ensure that the last pushed item is always popped first, adhering to the stack's LIFO principle.\n",
