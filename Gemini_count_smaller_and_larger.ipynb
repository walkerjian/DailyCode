We count all the elements below and to the right (excluding itself) because those elements will be larger. We break out of the inner loop as soon as we encounter a smaller element in the current row.\n",
        "This approach utilizes the sorted property of the rows and columns to efficiently find the count without needing to compare every element in the matrix.\n"
