        "This problem is essentially a simulation of dominoes falling. The string you're given represents a row of dominoes, each of which can be in one of three states:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. 'L' - the domino is tipping to the left.\n",
        "2. 'R' - the domino is tipping to the right.\n",
        "3. '.' - the domino is standing still.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to determine the final state of each domino when they stop falling. There are a few rules to consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A domino that tips to the left ('L') will cause the next domino to its left (if any) to also tip to the left.\n",
        "- A domino that tips to the right ('R') will cause the next domino to its right (if any) to also tip to the right.\n",
        "- If a domino receives forces from both sides (one domino tipping to the left on its right side and another tipping to the right on its left side), it remains upright.\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this, you can simulate the process of dominoes falling. Here's a basic approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Iterate through the string from left to right. If you find an 'R', mark the dominoes to its right as tipping to the right until you hit an 'L' or reach the end of the string.\n",
        "2. Iterate through the string from right to left. If you find an 'L', mark the dominoes to its left as tipping to the left until you hit an 'R' or reach the start of the string.\n",

This means that the dominoes that were pushed to the left or right have tipped over and affected their neighbors accordingly. The result is slightly different from the expected `LL.RRRLLL` due to the way the algorithm handles simultaneous forces.\n",

        "The discrepancy in the first example can be addressed by refining the algorithm to better handle cases where forces from opposite directions meet. The key to resolving the issue lies in more accurately simulating the interaction between opposing forces. When a rightward force (caused by a 'R') and a leftward force (caused by a 'L') meet, they should cancel each other out, leaving the dominoes in the middle standing upright. We can achieve this by keeping track of the distance to the nearest 'R' and 'L' for each domino.\n",
