        "Using a tree structure to represent the relationships between polynomials based on divisibility is an excellent idea. This approach can naturally capture the hierarchical nature of divisibility, where each node in the tree represents a polynomial, and a parent-child relationship between nodes represents divisibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how we could structure this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Nodes as Polynomials**: Each node in the tree represents a polynomial.\n",
        "2. **Parent-Child Relationship**: A node $ P $ is a parent of node $ Q $ if and only if polynomial $ P $ is divisible by polynomial $ Q $.\n",
        "3. **Building the Tree**: Start with the polynomial of highest degree as the root (or multiple roots if there are several polynomials of the same highest degree) and iteratively add polynomials to the tree under their respective divisors.\n",
        "4. **Finding the Largest Subset**: The largest divisible subset corresponds to the longest path(s) from the root to a leaf in the tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tree-based method would allow us to visually and logically organize the divisibility relationships and efficiently find the largest divisible subset.\n",

        "### Implementation Steps\n",
        "1. **Create Nodes**: Represent each polynomial as a node object.\n",
        "2. **Build the Tree**: For each polynomial, find its divisors in the set and establish parent-child links.\n",
        "3. **Traverse the Tree**: To find the largest divisible subset, perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find the longest path from the root to any leaf.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's sketch a conceptual implementation of this idea:\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement the tree structure for handling polynomials based on divisibility, we would follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialize the Tree**: Each polynomial becomes a node in the tree. We need to have a way to compare polynomials to determine their divisibility and thus establish parent-child relationships in the tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Build the Tree**:\n",
        "   - For each polynomial, we check against all others to see if it divides any of them without a remainder.\n",
        "   - If polynomial `A` divides polynomial `B`, then `A` becomes a parent of `B` in the tree.\n",
        "   - This process is repeated for all polynomials, building up the tree structure with these parent-child relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Find the Largest Subset**:\n",
        "   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) from each root (the polynomials of the highest degree) to find the longest path in the tree, which represents the largest divisible subset of polynomials.\n",
