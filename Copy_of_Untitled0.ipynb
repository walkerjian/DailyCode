        "To solve this problem, we can utilize a backtracking approach along with a trie data structure for efficient word lookup and prefix checking. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Trie Construction**: First, we'll build a trie from the dictionary words. This trie will help in efficient lookup of words and prefixes during our search.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Backtracking Search**: We'll use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible word paths on the board. For each cell, we'll start a depth-first search (DFS) that tries to form words by exploring adjacent cells (left, right, up, down).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Board State Management**: We'll maintain a dynamic state of the board using a 2D boolean array to mark cells that are currently used by the forming word to ensure each letter is only used once per word.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Word Validation**: As we build potential words using DFS, we check:\n",
        "   - If the current sequence of letters is a prefix to any word in the dictionary. If not, we prune the search.\n",
        "   - If the sequence is a complete word in the dictionary, we mark it as found, continue to try to find more words with remaining letters.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Maximization Strategy**: We aim to find the maximum number of words that can be formed. This requires managing and updating the best solution found at each step of the recursion. We'll keep track of the words formed and ensure that when exploring different paths, we maximize the number of non-overlapping words.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Result Compilation**: After exploring all possibilities, we return the maximum count of non-overlapping words that can be formed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This code sets up the Trie for dictionary lookup, then performs a DFS for each position in the board matrix, attempting to form and count valid words. The approach ensures that each letter can only be used once per found word and maximizes the count of non"
