        "1. The Board class (representing the Model) initializes a board from a given matrix and provides a method to check if a given move is valid.\n",

        "3. The Controller is our BFS-based `find_shortest_path` function that computes the shortest path between two points on a board.\n",
        "4. The `test` function acts as a harness to validate the correctness of our solution with various test cases.\n",
        "The `BFS-based find_shortest_path` function is a function that utilizes the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to determine the shortest path between two points on a grid or graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the source node (a selected one) and explores as wide as possible before moving to the next depth level.\n",
        "\n",
        "When applied to our grid (in the context of the problem you presented), the BFS-based function systematically explores all paths starting from the source coordinate and expands outward. It keeps track of the number of steps required to reach each point. As soon as the destination coordinate is reached, since BFS traverses the shortest path first, we can be assured that the path found is the shortest one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a quick breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Begin at the start coordinate and enqueue it.\n",
        "2. Dequeue the first coordinate and check all its neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n",
        "3. If a neighbor is walkable (not a wall) and has not been visited before, enqueue it with an incremented step count.\n",
        "4. Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the destination coordinate is dequeued.\n",
        "5. If the destination is dequeued, the associated step count is the shortest path.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function maintains a `visited` set to ensure that we don't process a cell more than once and to prevent cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary advantage of using BFS for this problem is that it guarantees the shortest path due to its level-wise exploration nature."
