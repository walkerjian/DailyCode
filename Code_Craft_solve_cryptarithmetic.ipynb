        "A cryptarithmetic puzzle is a mathematical game where the digits of some numbers are represented by letters. Each letter represents a unique digit.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a puzzle of the form:\n",
        "```\n",
        "  SEND\n",
        "+ MORE\n",
        "--------\n",
        " MONEY\n",
        "```\n",
        "may have the solution:\n",
        "```\n",
        "{'S': 9, 'E': 5, 'N': 6, 'D': 7, 'M': 1, 'O', 0, 'R': 8, 'Y': 2}\n",
        "```\n",
        "Given a three-word puzzle like the one above, create an algorithm that finds a solution.\n",
        "##Solution:\n",
        "To create an algorithm to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle like the one you've described, we can follow these general steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **List all Unique Letters**: Identify all the unique letters used in the puzzle.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Generate Possible Assignments**: Generate all possible assignments of digits to these letters. Since each letter represents a unique digit and there are 10 digits (0-9), this step involves generating permutations of 10 digits taken `n` at a time, where `n` is the number of unique letters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Validate Assignments**: For each assignment, substitute the letters in the puzzle with their corresponding digits and check if the sum is correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Return Solution**: Once a valid assignment is found, return it as the solution. If no assignment validates the puzzle, report that there is no solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's implement this algorithm in Python. Note that this solution might not be the most efficient for larger puzzles due to the computational cost of generating and checking all permutations, but it works well for puzzles with a small number of unique letters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm successfully solved the cryptarithmetic puzzle \"SEND + MORE = MONEY\". The solution it found is:\n",
        "```\n",
        "- S = 9\n",
        "- E = 5\n",
        "- N = 6\n",
        "- D = 7\n",
        "- M = 1\n",
        "- O = 0\n",
        "- R = 8\n",
        "- Y = 2\n",
        "```\n",
        "This means, when substituting these values into the puzzle, the equation holds true:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "  9567\n",
        "+ 1085\n",
        "------\n",
        " 10652\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use this algorithm for solving similar three-word cryptarithmetic puzzles. Keep in mind that the algorithm's efficiency decreases with an increase in the number of unique letters, as it checks all possible digit assignments.\n",
