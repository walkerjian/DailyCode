        "\n",
        "You are given an array of length n + 1 whose elements belong to the set {1, 2, ..., n}. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. Find it in linear time and space.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Pigeonhole Principle\n",
        "\n",
        "### Definition:\n",
        "The Pigeonhole Principle is a straightforward yet powerful concept in combinatorics. It states that if \\( n \\) items are put into \\( m \\) pigeonholes with \\( n > m \\), then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one item.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Intuitive Explanation:\n",
        "Imagine you have 10 pigeonholes and 11 pigeons. If you were to place each pigeon in a pigeonhole, at least one of the pigeonholes would contain 2 pigeons, because there are more pigeons than pigeonholes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Application to our problem:\n",
        "In the context of our problem, the array has length \\( n + 1 \\) and contains elements from 1 to \\( n \\). This means there are \\( n + 1 \\) \"pigeons\" (the numbers in the array) and \\( n \\) \"pigeonholes\" (the possible distinct values). According to the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one value (pigeonhole) must be repeated.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and the Hare)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Background:\n",
        "Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, often known as the \"Tortoise and the Hare\" algorithm, is used to detect cycles in sequences. It uses two pointers that move through the sequence at different speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How it works:\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Two pointers, a slow one (tortoise) and a fast one (hare), are initialized at the beginning of the sequence.\n",
        "2. **Move**: The tortoise moves one step at a time while the hare moves two steps.\n",
        "3. **Cycle Detection**: If there is a cycle, the hare will eventually catch up to the tortoise.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why it works (Proof):\n",
        "- If a cycle exists, consider the length of the cycle as \\( \\lambda \\).\n",
        "- After \\( \\lambda \\) steps, the hare would have moved \\( 2\\lambda \\) steps while the tortoise would have moved \\( \\lambda \\) steps. This means the hare has moved an entire cycle more than the tortoise and they are at the same position, proving the cycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Application to our problem:\n",
        "The problem of finding duplicates can be thought of as detecting a cycle in a linked list. Each value in the array points to an index in the array, forming a sequence. If there's a duplicate, it means two values are pointing to the same index, creating a cycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using the Tortoise and the Hare algorithm, we can detect this cycle and thereby find the duplicate value.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Proof of correctness for duplicate detection:\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Both tortoise and hare start at the first position in the array.\n",
        "2. **Move**: Tortoise moves to the index given by the current value while the hare moves two such indices.\n",
        "3. **Cycle Detection**: Once a cycle is detected (when tortoise equals hare), reinitialize the hare to the beginning and move both hare and tortoise one step at a time. When they meet again, that position is the beginning of the cycle and represents the duplicate value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason this works is because of the structure of the list. The duplicate value creates a loop, and when the hare and tortoise meet after detecting the cycle, moving them again one step at a time from their respective positions ensures they meet at the start of this loop, which corresponds to the duplicate value.\n",
        "\n",
        "I hope this provides a clear understanding of both principles and their application to the problem at hand!"
