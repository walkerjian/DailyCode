For example, in the sentence \"I went to get money from the bank\", bank probably means the place where people deposit money, not the land beside a river or lake.\n",

        "Creating an algorithm for word sense disambiguation (WSD) involves several steps, including understanding the context in which a word is used, comparing it to the known meanings, and determining the most likely meaning based on that context. For this task, we'll design a simple WSD algorithm that follows these general steps:\n",

        "3. **Meaning Selection**: Compare the context of the ambiguous word with the provided meanings to select the most appropriate one. This can be done through simple keyword matching, semantic similarity, or more advanced techniques.\n",
