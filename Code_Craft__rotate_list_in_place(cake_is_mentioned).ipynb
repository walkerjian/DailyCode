        "To rotate a list by \\(k\\) elements without creating a copy of the list, we can use an in-place approach. The number of swap or move operations needed will depend on the specific algorithm used. A common in-place method is to use reversal:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reverse the entire list**: This step makes the last element come to the beginning, effectively preparing the list for a split based on \\(k\\).\n",
        "2. **Reverse the first \\(k\\) elements**: Since the list is reversed, the last \\(k\\) elements are now at the beginning. Reversing them puts them in the correct order for the rotation.\n",
        "3. **Reverse the remaining elements**: Finally, reversing the rest of the list (elements \\(k+1\\) to \\(n\\)) puts them in their correct post-rotation position.\n",
