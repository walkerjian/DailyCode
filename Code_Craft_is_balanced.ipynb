We'll define a helper function that will calculate the height of the tree and also check if the tree is balanced. If we detect that any subtree is unbalanced, we propagate that information up the recursive call stack. This ensures that the overall complexity remains linear, O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",
