        "1. Build a graph of letters, where each letter is a node, and directed edges are drawn between letters to indicate order.\n",

        "The graph can be constructed as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Compare each word in the dictionary to its next word.\n",
        "2. For each pair of words, compare characters from the start.\n",
        "3. As soon as the characters differ, we know that the character from the first word comes before the character from the second word in the language's order.\n",
        "4. Draw a directed edge between these two characters in the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the graph is constructed, we can perform a topological sort to determine the order of letters.\n",
