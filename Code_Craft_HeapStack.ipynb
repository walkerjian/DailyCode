        "##Solution:\n",
        "Implementing a stack API using only a heap requires a strategy to maintain the stack's Last In, First Out (LIFO) order using the heap's structure, which naturally follows a different order, either Min Heap (the smallest element is always on top) or Max Heap (the largest element is always on top).\n",
        "\n",
        "The core challenge is that a heap is designed to efficiently remove the smallest or largest element (depending on if it's a min-heap or max-heap), not the most recently added element. To simulate stack behavior (LIFO) with a heap, we can use timestamps or an increasing counter to keep track of the insertion order. By associating each element pushed onto the \"stack\" with an incrementing count, we can ensure that the most recently pushed item can be identified as having the highest count. Thus, by using a max-heap based on these counts, the item most recently added will always be at the top of the heap.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a Python class that implements a stack using a max heap. We'll use the heapq module, which provides an implementation of the min heap. To create a max heap, we'll store tuples in the heap with a count that decreases with each push (as Python's heapq is a min heap, we invert the count to simulate max heap behavior):\n",

The `push` method adds elements with their count to the heap, and the `pop` method retrieves and removes the element with the highest count, effectively mimicking stack behavior."
