        "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to traverse the matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, keeping track of the maximum number of coins that can be collected up to each cell. For each cell, we can only come from the top or left (since we can only move right or down), so the maximum number of coins up to that cell will be the maximum of the coins collected from the top and left, plus the coins in the current cell.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Initialize the top-left cell of `dp` with the value of the top-left cell of the input matrix, since that's our starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Iterate over the matrix row by row and column by column:\n",
        "    - For each cell, calculate the maximum coins that can be collected by either coming from the left (if not in the first column) or from the top (if not in the first row).\n",
        "    - Update the `dp` matrix with this maximum value.\n",
