        "### Task:\n",
        "PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.\n",
        "\n",
        "More mathematically, suppose there are N sites, and each site i has a certain count Ci of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site Sj is defined as :\n",
        "\n",
        "score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz))\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, Sx, Sy, ..., Sz denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to Sj, and d is a damping factor, usually set to around 0.85, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements:\n",
        "````\n",
        "1) use the MVC paradigm.\n",
        "2) extensively document your code with a docstring for the initial problem as specified.\n",
        "3) all code to be uninterrupted and not truncated.\n",
        "4) extensively test the code; write a test function to test the code with at least 10 test examples. Make sure the test harness does not interrupt the output of the test cases, which should include the sample cases given to you. All output needs to include the original example or test case, and complete output of the solution.\n",
        "5) do not make up solutions, make sure your solution is correct & adheres to all requirements above.\n",
        "6) use PEP8 & nice formatting rules for word wrap.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **View**:\n",
        "   - `PageRankView`: This class is responsible for rendering the output. In this case, it's a simple print of the PageRank scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Controller**:\n",
        "   - `PageRankController`: This class ties the model and view together. It initializes with a graph, creates a `PageRankModel`, and a `PageRankView`. The `calculate_and_display_page_rank` method triggers the calculation of PageRank scores and passes the results to the view for display.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Test Harness**:\n",
        "   - `test_page_rank`: This function includes a list of test cases. Each test case is a directed graph represented as an adjacency matrix. The function iterates through each test case, creates a `PageRankController` instance, and invokes `calculate_and_display_page_rank` to calculate and display the PageRank scores.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Website Relevance**: Websites with higher PageRank scores are considered more important or relevant within this network. They are likely to have more incoming links from other websites, or links from other highly-ranked websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Link Structure Analysis**: The PageRank scores can help analysts understand the link structure within the network. For instance, if a website has a high PageRank score, it's worth investigating which websites link to it and the PageRank scores of those websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Potential Influence**: Websites with higher PageRank scores may potentially have more influence within this network. They could be good targets for advertising, partnerships, or other collaborative efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Link Improvement Suggestions**: If a website has a lower PageRank score than desired, it might be beneficial to increase the number of incoming links from high-ranked websites to improve its PageRank score.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Comparison**: By comparing the PageRank scores, an analyst can identify which websites are relatively more important within this network.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Network Dynamics**: Over time, changes in the link structure (e.g., new links, removed links) will affect the PageRank scores. Monitoring these changes can provide insights into the evolving dynamics of this network.\n",

        "These interpretations provide a high-level understanding of the network's structure and the relative importance of each website within it based on the PageRank algorithm."
