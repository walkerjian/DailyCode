The `update` method will increment the number of subscribers at a specific hour, and the `query` method will sum the subscribers between the given start and end hours.\n",

        "2. `update(hour, value)`: Increments the subscribers count for the given hour by the specified value.\n",
        "3. `query(start, end)`: Returns the total number of subscribers from the start hour to the end hour, inclusive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, I'll provide some test inputs after defining the class to demonstrate its functionality without interrupting the flow of code execution."
