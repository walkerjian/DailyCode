In other words, for any octonions \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the associator \\([(a, b, c) = (ab)c - a(bc)\\]\\) is alternating, meaning that \\(a(ba) = (ab)a\\), \\(b(ab) = (ba)b\\), and so on.\n",

        "   - **`numpy-quaternion`**: While `numpy` itself doesn't have native support for quaternions, this library adds quaternion support to numpy. It's useful for 3D rotations and applications in graphics and physics.\n",
        "   - **`sympy`**: The symbolic mathematics library for Python has support for quaternions and can be used for algebraic manipulations.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Mathematica**:\n",
        "   - Mathematica has built-in support for quaternions and provides functions for their manipulation. It also offers tools for symbolic algebra, which can be leveraged to work with other algebras.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **MATLAB**:\n",
        "   - MATLAB has a toolbox called **`Quaternion Toolbox`** that provides a comprehensive set of operations and functions for manipulating quaternions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **C++**:\n",
        "   - **`boost`**: The Boost C++ libraries include a `boost::math::quaternion` class that provides support for quaternions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Others**:\n",
        "   - Various specialized software and libraries exist for specific applications, especially in computer graphics, robotics, and physics, where quaternions and other algebras are commonly used.\n",

        "\n",

        "   - We began with a generalized multiplication function that could handle the multiplication of real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions.\n",
        "   - The multiplication was based on the rules specific to each algebra, with complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions having distinct multiplication tables based on their properties.\n",

        "2. **Extension to Complex Numbers**:\n",
        "   - We extended the function to handle the inclusion of complex numbers, allowing a mix of real and complex numbers in the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Extension to Quaternions**:\n",
        "   - The function was further extended to handle quaternions, and we ensured that it could still operate on both real numbers and complex numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Extension to Octonions**:\n",
        "   - We then expanded our scope to the octonions, which are 8-dimensional hypercomplex numbers. The multiplication table for octonions was incorporated into our function, and we ensured that the function could still handle real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Unified Function**:\n",
        "   - We created a unified function that could handle the multiplication of real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions, all within a single framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Extension to Sedenions**:\n",
        "   - Upon your request, we further extended the function to handle the multiplication of sedenions, which are 16-dimensional hypercomplex numbers. This was achieved using the Cayley-Dickson construction, which is a recursive doubling process.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Additional Functionalities**:\n",
        "   - We added functionalities like conjugation and basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) to support the multiplication process, especially for the sedenions.\n",
