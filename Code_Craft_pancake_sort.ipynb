        "To sort a list using only the `reverse(lst, i, j)` operation, where `lst` is the list to be sorted, and `i` and `j` are the indices between which the list should be reversed, we can implement a sorting algorithm that relies solely on reversals to achieve a sorted list. This task can be approached by adapting the concept of Pancake Sorting, which essentially uses a series of flips (or reversals) to sort an array.\n",

        "The Pancake Sorting algorithm involves the following steps:\n",
        "1. Find the maximum element in the list.\n",
        "2. Use `reverse(lst, 0, max_index)` to bring the maximum element to the front (if it's not already at the front).\n",
        "3. Then, use `reverse(lst, 0, n-1)` to move the maximum element to its correct position at the end of the list.\n",
        "4. Repeat the process for the sublist that excludes the last element, which is now in its correct position, until the whole list is sorted.\n"
