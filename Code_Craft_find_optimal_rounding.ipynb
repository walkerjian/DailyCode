        "\n",
        "2. **Calculate the Differences and Sort**: For each element in `X`, calculate the difference between the number and its nearest integer (both floor and ceiling). This will help in deciding whether to round up or down.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Distribute the Rounding to Match the Sum**: We need to ensure that the sum of the rounded elements in `Y` matches the original rounded sum. To do this, we will round up or down based on the calculated differences, prioritizing the rounding that keeps us closest to the target sum.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Minimize Absolute Pairwise Difference**: While ensuring the sums match, we will also aim to minimize the absolute pairwise difference between elements of `X` and `Y`.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will now implement this algorithm and test it with the provided example and a few additional test cases."
