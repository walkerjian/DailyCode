        "A regular number in mathematics is defined as one which evenly divides some power of 60. Equivalently, we can say that a regular number is one whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5.\n",

        "To write a program that returns the first N regular numbers, we can follow a methodical approach to generate these numbers. Since a regular number is defined as one whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5, we can use a priority queue (or a similar structure) to generate these numbers in a sequential and efficient manner.\n",

        "Here's the general idea of the algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialize a set or priority queue to store the regular numbers, and add the number 1 to it since it's the smallest regular number.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Pop the smallest number from the set or priority queue. This will be one of our regular numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Multiply this number by 2, 3, and 5 and add those products back into the set or queue if they are not already present. This ensures that all multiples of the current regular number with 2, 3, or 5 are considered for subsequent regular numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until we have generated N regular numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Return the list of N regular numbers.\n",
