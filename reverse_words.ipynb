        "## Testing\n",
        "Testing the code to ensure correctness involved the creation and execution of a test suite, which tested various scenarios to validate the functionality. Here's a breakdown of how the testing was conducted:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Test Cases:\n",
        "The test suite included a variety of test cases that were designed to cover different scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and potential corner cases. The test cases included in the suite were:\n",
        "- Standard input with single delimiters between words.\n",
        "- Input with a trailing delimiter.\n",
        "- Input with consecutive delimiters.\n",
        "- Input with different types of delimiters.\n",
        "- Edge cases, including an input with only delimiters and an empty input string.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Test Suite Function:\n",
        "A specific test suite function (`test_suite`) was created to run all the test cases. This function contained a loop that iterated through the test cases and called the processing method for each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. MVC Structure:\n",
        "The code was structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The model contained the core logic for reversing the words and maintaining the order of the delimiters, the view handled displaying the results, and the controller mediated between the model and the view.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Output Display:\n",
        "For each test case, both the input string and the corresponding output were printed, allowing for a visual inspection of the results. This helped in verifying that the words were correctly reversed while keeping the delimiters in their original positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Error Handling:\n",
        "The test suite was designed to continue processing all test cases even if an error occurred in one of them. This allowed for complete execution of the suite and helped in identifying potential issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Revisions and Corrections:\n",
        "After initial testing, some issues were identified, and the code was revised and corrected. The test suite was run again to verify that the corrected code produced the expected results.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining these testing strategies, I was able to thoroughly test the code for correctness and ensure that it handled a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and different input formats. The output of the test suite confirmed that the code meets the requirements of the problem statement and behaves as expected."

        "## Synopsis of how the solution was converged to:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Initial Approach:\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Problem:** The task was to reverse the words in a given string while maintaining the relative order of the delimiters.\n",
        "2. **First Implementation:** A first attempt was made by separating the words and delimiters and then trying to reconstruct the string by reversing the words.\n",
        "3. **Test Suite:** A comprehensive test suite was created to include various scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and inputs with multiple consecutive delimiters.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Encountering Issues:\n",
        "4. **Initial Error:** Running the test suite revealed an \"IndexError\" due to incorrect handling of the delimiters when reconstructing the result string.\n",
        "5. **First Correction:** An attempt was made to correct the error by keeping track of both the delimiters and their positions, but it still led to an index error.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Revising the Solution:\n",
        "6. **Analyzing the Problem:** The core issue was identified as not properly handling the case when a word was followed by multiple delimiters.\n",
        "7. **Segmentation Approach:** A revised approach was taken to separate the input string into segments of words and delimiters. This allowed for more precise control over the reversal of words and the placement of delimiters.\n",
        "8. **Handling Multiple Consecutive Delimiters:** By treating multiple consecutive delimiters as individual segments, the revised solution was able to handle various delimiter patterns.\n",
        "9. **Reconstruction with Reversed Words:** The final step involved reconstructing the result string using the reversed words and original delimiters, keeping them in their respective positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Testing and Validation:\n",
        "10. **Running the Corrected Code:** The corrected code was run with the test suite to verify its correctness.\n",
        "11. **Successful Testing:** The code passed all the test cases, successfully reversing the words while maintaining the relative order of the delimiters.\n",
        "12. **Detailed Documentation:** The final code was documented with extensive inline and docstring comments to explain the reasoning, modifications, and final solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "Through iterative development, testing, and revisions, a robust solution was achieved that met the requirements of the problem statement. The process highlighted the importance of careful analysis, iterative development, and comprehensive testing in arriving at a correct and well-documented solution."
