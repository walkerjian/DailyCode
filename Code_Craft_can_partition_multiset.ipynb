        "To solve this problem, we can use a technique called dynamic programming. The key idea is to determine if there's a subset within the multiset that sums up to half of the total sum of all the elements. If such a subset exists, it means the remaining elements also sum up to the same value, thus allowing the multiset to be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums.\n",

        "Here's the approach in detail:\n",
        "1. Calculate the total sum of all elements in the multiset.\n",
        "2. If the total sum is odd, it's impossible to partition the set into two subsets with equal sum, so we return false.\n",
        "3. If the sum is even, we check if there's a subset that sums up to half of the total sum using dynamic programming.\n",
        "4. This is akin to solving a 0/1 knapsack problem where we try to find if there's a combination of numbers that sums up to a specific target (half of the total sum in this case).\n"
