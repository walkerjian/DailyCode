        "2. Find the overlap along the x-axis and y-axis. This can be achieved by taking the maximum of the lower x-coordinates and the minimum of the higher x-coordinates for the x-axis, and similarly for the y-axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. If there is an overlap, the area of the intersection is the product of the overlap along the x-axis and the overlap along the y-axis. If there is no overlap (meaning the maximum of the lower coordinates is greater than the minimum of the higher coordinates on either axis), the rectangles do not intersect, and the area is 0."
