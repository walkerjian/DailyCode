The min-heap helps maintain the order of elements efficiently, ensuring that each element is placed in its correct position in $ O(\\log k) $ time. Hereâ€™s how we can achieve this:\n",

        "2. **Maintaining the Heap**: As we iterate over the remaining elements of the array, we keep extracting the smallest element from the heap and adding the next element from the array to the heap. This ensures that the heap always contains the next $ k+1 $ elements to be processed.\n",
