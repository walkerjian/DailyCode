        "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The key insight is that at any step of the game, the best move can be determined by knowing the optimal outcomes of the smaller subproblems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a row of coins of length `N`, we define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum amount of money you can win if you move first, with the row of coins from index `i` to index `j`. The opponent also plays optimally, so when it's their turn, they will choose a coin such that they leave you with the minimum possible value.\n",

        "The recurrence relation for our dynamic programming solution is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$ dp[i][j] = \\max( v[i] + \\min(dp[i+2][j], dp[i+1][j-1]), v[j] + \\min(dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i][j-2]) ) $\n",
        "\n",
        "This relation uses the fact that after your move, the opponent will choose optimally, leaving you with the row `[i+2, j]` or `[i+1, j-1]` if you choose the first coin (`v[i]`), or with the row `[i+1, j-1]` or `[i, j-2]` if you choose the last coin (`v[j]`). You want to maximize your gain while the opponent aims to minimize your next move's gain, hence the use of `min` inside the `max` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The base case for our dynamic programming table will be when `i == j`, meaning there is only one coin left, so `dp[i][i] = v[i]`. For the cases where we have two coins, `dp[i][i+1] = max(v[i], v[i+1])` since you'll pick the maximum of the two.\n",
