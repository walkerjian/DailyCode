        "To solve this problem, you can use a simple algorithm that tracks characters as they appear in the string. By iterating through the string and storing each character in a set, you can check if a character has appeared before. The first character that is already in the set is the first recurring character. If no character recurs, you return `null` (or its equivalent in the programming language you're using).\n",

        "\n",
        "This function iterates through each character in the string `s`. It uses a set called `seen` to track which characters have been encountered. If a character is already in the `seen` set, it means the character has recurred, and the function returns that character. If the loop completes without finding any recurring characters, the function returns `None`."
