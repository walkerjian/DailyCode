        "##Solution:\n",
        "### Understanding the Task\n",
        "1. **Task Semantics**: We are given a string `s` of length `N` and a parameter `k`. We can select any one of the first `k` characters of `s` and move it to the end of the string. This operation can be performed any number of times.\n",
        "2. **Objective**: Find the lexicographically smallest string that can be achieved by applying the above operation any number of times.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Analysis\n",
        "- When `k = 1`, only the first character can be moved to the end. This means we can only rotate the string. The smallest lexicographic string is found by rotating the string until its smallest character is at the front. If there are multiple occurrences of this smallest character, we need to check subsequent characters to determine the earliest position to start from.\n",
        "- When `k > 1`, we have more flexibility, as any of the first `k` characters can be moved. In this case, the lexicographically smallest string can be achieved more easily because we can essentially bubble the smallest character within the first `k` positions to the front.\n",
        "\n",
        "### MVC Design\n",
        "- **Model**: Will contain the logic for determining the smallest string. It takes a string and a value of `k` and returns the modified string.\n",
        "- **View**: A simple representation of the input and output. For our purpose, the input prompt and the output display in the console will serve as the view.\n",
        "- **Controller**: Manages the input and output flow and invokes the model. It will take the string and `k`, pass it to the model, and then display the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation and Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Model\n",
        "This part contains the core logic of our task. It's a function that takes `s` and `k` and returns the smallest lexicographically string.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Controller\n",
        "This part will handle the user input and display the output. It uses the model to get the smallest string and then prints it.\n",

The controller function, `process_string`, handles the interaction, feeding inputs to the model and displaying the output."
