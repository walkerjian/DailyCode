        "To solve this problem, we can think about it probabilistically. Each round, every coin has a 50% chance of landing on tails and being set aside. The process repeats until only one coin is left. We want to calculate the expected number of rounds for this to happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's denote $ E(n) $ as the expected number of rounds for $ n $ coins. On the first flip, each coin has a 50% chance of being set aside, so on average, half of the coins will remain. Therefore, after the first round, we expect to have $ \\frac{n}{2} $ coins left. We can express this as a recursive relationship:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$E(n) = 1 + E\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This equation says that the expected number of rounds for $ n $ coins is 1 (for the first round) plus the expected number of rounds for the remaining $ \\frac{n}{2} $ coins.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the recursion stops when we have only one coin left. At that point, $ E(1) = 0 $, since no more rounds are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll implement a Python function to calculate the expected number of rounds for a given number of coins $ n $ using this approach. The function will use memoization to avoid redundant calculations for the same number of coins."
