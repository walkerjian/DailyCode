        "To find the longest palindromic contiguous substring in a given string, we can use a method called \"expand around center\". The idea is to treat every character of the input string as a potential center of a palindrome, and then expand outwards to find the palindrome. Since a palindrome can have either an odd or an even length, we need to check both cases.\n",

        "For every character in the string, we consider it as the center of a potential odd-length palindrome and try to expand outwards. Similarly, for every pair of adjacent characters in the string, we consider them as the center of a potential even-length palindrome and try to expand outwards.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the expansion, if the characters being compared are the same, we continue expanding. If they are different, we stop and record the palindrome if it's the longest one found so far."
