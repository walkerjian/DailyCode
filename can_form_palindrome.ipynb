        "##Rationale:\n",
        "The logic to determine whether any permutation of a given string is a palindrome is based on the following principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Character Frequency**: A palindrome has a symmetrical structure. In terms of character frequency, this means that all the characters must occur in pairs (an even number of times), except for at most one character that can occur once if the string's length is odd. This unpaired character would be the middle character in the palindrome.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Odd Count Check**: We count the frequency of each character in the string using a `Counter`. Then, we calculate how many characters appear an odd number of times. If more than one character has an odd count, then it is impossible to form a palindrome from any permutation of the string.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Palindrome Condition**: A string can be permuted to form a palindrome if the number of characters with an odd frequency is less than or equal to one. This condition allows for:\n",
        "   - Even-length strings to have all characters with even counts.\n",
        "   - Odd-length strings to have exactly one character with an odd count (which would be the middle character in the palindrome).\n",
        "\n",
        "The function `can_form_palindrome` implements this logic as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the input string.\n",
        "- It then checks for the number of characters that have an odd count.\n",
        "- Finally, it returns `True` if there is at most one character with an odd count, and `False` otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "This logic was tested with a series of test cases that were designed to cover various scenarios, including edge cases like an empty string, single-character string, and pathological cases like a very long string with identical characters. The test harness verified that the function behaves as expected across these different cases."
