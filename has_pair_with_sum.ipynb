        "3) all code to be uninterrupted and not truncated.\n",

Make sure the test harness does not interrupt the output of the test cases, which should include the sample cases given to you. All output needs to include the original example or test case, and complete output of the solution.\n",

        "The model will contain the main algorithm to solve the problem. Given a list of numbers and a number \\( k \\), it will determine if any two numbers in the list add up to \\( k \\). We can achieve this in a single pass by using a set to store the numbers we've seen so far. For each number in the list, we'll check if \\( k \\) minus that number exists in our set. If it does, then we have a pair of numbers that add up to \\( k \\). Otherwise, we'll add the current number to our set and continue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### View\n",

        "The view will be responsible for formatting and presenting the output. For each test case, it will display the input list, the target sum \\( k \\), and the result (either `True` or `False`).\n",

        "### Controller\n",
        "\n",
