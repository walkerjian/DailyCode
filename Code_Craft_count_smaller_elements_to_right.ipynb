        "##Solution:\n",
        "The algorithm to find the number of smaller elements to the right of each element in an array is implemented as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialize a Result Array**: A new array `counts` of the same length as the input array `nums` is created, initialized with zeros. This array will store the count of smaller elements to the right of each element in the input array.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterate Through the Array**: The main part of the algorithm involves iterating through the input array from the second-to-last element to the first element (in reverse order). The reason for starting from the end and moving backwards is that we are interested in elements to the \"right\" of the current element. The last element of the array is skipped in this loop because there are no elements to its right, so it will always have a count of 0 for smaller elements to its right (this is handled by the initialization step).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Count Smaller Elements for Each Element**: For each element at index `i`, the algorithm iterates through all elements to its right (from index `i+1` to the end of the array). If an element to the right is smaller than the current element, a counter (`count`) is incremented. This process essentially compares the current element with each of its right-hand neighbors to count how many of them are smaller.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Update the Result Array**: After counting the smaller elements to the right of the current element, the count is stored in the corresponding position of the `counts` array.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Handle the Last Element**: The last element of the array is automatically assigned a count of 0, as there are no elements to its right. This step is implicitly handled by the initialization of the `counts` array with zeros.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Return the Result Array**: Once all elements have been processed, the `counts` array, which now contains the count of smaller elements to the right of each element in the input array, is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "This brute-force approach works well for small to medium-sized arrays but can be inefficient for very large arrays due to its quadratic time complexity, \\(O(n^2)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the input array. The inefficiency arises because for each element, it scans all the elements to its right, resulting in a significant number of comparisons, especially for elements towards the beginning of the array."
