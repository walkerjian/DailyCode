        "1. Masking all odd bits with `0xAAAAAAAA` (which in binary is `10101010...`) and shifting them right by 1.\n",

        "##Explanation:\n",
        "The lambda function I used is a concise way to define a small anonymous function in Python. It's particularly handy for simple operations like the one we're dealing with. Let me break down how the bit swapping works in the lambda function:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "swap_bits = lambda x: ((x & 0xAA) >> 1) | ((x & 0x55) << 1)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Lambda Function**:\n",
        "   - `lambda x:`: This part declares an anonymous function with `x` as its input argument. `x` is expected to be the 8-bit integer you want to manipulate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Masking and Shifting Odd Bits**:\n",
        "   - `(x & 0xAA)`: This operation uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to mask the input `x`. The mask `0xAA` (which is `10101010` in binary) isolates the odd bits of `x`. For instance, if `x` is `10101010`, this step results in `10101010` (since `10101010` AND `10101010` is `10101010`).\n",
        "   - `>> 1`: This shifts the result of the masking one bit to the right. Continuing the example, `10101010` becomes `01010101`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Masking and Shifting Even Bits**:\n",
        "   - `(x & 0x55)`: Here, `0x55` (which is `01010101` in binary) is used to mask the even bits of `x`. For example, if `x` is `10101010`, this step results in `00000000` (since `10101010` AND `01010101` is `00000000`).\n",
        "   - `<< 1`: This shifts the result of this masking one bit to the left. In the example, `00000000` remains `00000000`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Combining the Results**:\n",
        "   - `|`: The bitwise OR operator `|` is used to combine the results of the two previous operations. It effectively places the shifted odd bits and the shifted even bits into their new positions. For example, combining `01010101` and `00000000` results in `01010101`.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, this lambda function takes an 8-bit integer, separates its even and odd bits, shifts them in opposite directions, and then combines them back together. This process swaps the even and odd bits as desired.\n",
        "\n",
        "`swap_bits` in the provided code snippet is the name given to the lambda function. It's essentially a function variable. When you assign a lambda function to a variable like `swap_bits`, you can then use that variable name as you would any other function name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `swap_bits =`: This part of the code is assigning the lambda function to a variable named `swap_bits`.\n",
        "- `lambda x:`: This declares an anonymous function with `x` as its input parameter.\n",
        "- `((x & 0xAA) >> 1) | ((x & 0x55) << 1)`: This is the body of the function, which performs the bit-swapping operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once `swap_bits` is defined in this way, you can use it to invoke the bit-swapping operation. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "result = swap_bits(0b10101010)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this line, `swap_bits` is called with `0b10101010` as an argument. The lambda function then executes its bit-swapping logic on this argument, and the result is stored in the variable `result`."
