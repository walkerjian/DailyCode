        "##Solution:\n",
        "To determine if an undirected graph is minimally-connected, we need to check two conditions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The graph is connected: There's a path between every pair of vertices.\n",
        "2. The graph is minimally connected: Removing any edge would make the graph disconnected. This is equivalent to saying the graph has no cycles because if a cycle exists, we could remove an edge from the cycle, and the graph would still be connected.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can represent the graph using an adjacency list for efficiency, as it's more space-efficient for sparse graphs and easier to iterate over neighbors of a vertex.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how we can approach this problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to check if the graph is connected.\n",
        "2. During the DFS, check for cycles. If we encounter a node that has been visited and is not the direct parent, a cycle exists, and the graph is not minimally-connected.\n",
