        "1. Initialize two variables, `flips` and `y_count`. `flips` will store the total number of flips required, and `y_count` will keep track of the number of 'y's encountered so far.\n",
        "2. Iterate through each character in the string:\n",
        "   - If the character is 'y', increment `y_count` by 1.\n",
        "   - If the character is 'x', increment `flips` by `y_count`. This is because, to move this 'x' before all 'y's seen so far, we would need to flip it once for each 'y'.\n",
        "3. Return the value of `flips`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's implement this in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of flips required to ensure all 'x's come before all 'y's in the string \"xyxxxyxyy\" is 5. This result is obtained by counting each 'x' that appears after a 'y' in the string and summing up these occurrences."
