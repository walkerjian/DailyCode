        "Solve this coding problem professionally using modern software development patterns, particularly the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for clarity and maintainability. Ensure that the test harness is well-thought-out and professional, with logic that ensures all tests run, even when some fail. If a test fails, the harness should also test the test logic to ensure it's not the source of failure. This should be treated as a learning exercise, so the solution must include detailed explanations (didactic perspective) at each step, including complexity analysis, optimizations, and alternative approaches. If any tests or code fail, include a post-mortem analysis of the failure. Use languages other than Python where appropriate, and ensure readability and understanding of the solution.\n",

        "To merge two sorted iterators without pulling their contents into memory, you can use a technique that lazily yields elements in sorted order. The key idea is to maintain a lookahead for each iterator, comparing their current elements and yielding the smaller one while advancing that iterator.\n",

        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def merge_iterators(iter1, iter2):\n",
        "    # Initialize lookahead values for both iterators\n",

        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "1. **Lookahead Strategy**: We use `next()` to \"peek\" at the next value from each iterator (`iter1` and `iter2`).\n",
        "   - If an iterator is exhausted, we set a sentinel value to indicate that it has no more elements.\n",
        "2. **Comparison and Yielding**: In each iteration of the loop:\n",
        "   - If one iterator is exhausted (marked by the sentinel), we yield elements from the other iterator.\n",
        "   - If both iterators have values, we compare them and yield the smaller one, advancing the iterator that provided it.\n",
        "3. **Termination**: The loop continues until both iterators are exhausted.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "foo = iter([5, 10, 15])\n",
        "bar = iter([3, 8, 9])\n",
