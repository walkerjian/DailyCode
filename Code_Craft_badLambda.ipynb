        "##Solution:\n",
        "The given code snippet creates a list of anonymous functions (lambdas), each of which is supposed to return the value of `i` at the time the lambda was created. However, due to Python's late binding behavior for closures, all of the functions end up referring to the same `i` variable, which is equal to 9 at the end of the loop (after `range(10)` finishes). Consequently, when each function in `functions` is called, they all return `9`.\n",
        "\n",
        "To fix this, you need to ensure that the value of `i` is captured at the time each lambda is created. This can be done by passing `i` as a default argument to the lambda. Here is the corrected version of the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this corrected version, `i=i` in the lambda function creates a new scope for `i`. Each lambda now has its own default argument `i` that preserves the value of `i` as it was at the time the lambda was created. When you run this code, it will print out numbers from 0 to 9, as expected."

        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting and Filtering**: With functions like `sorted()` or `filter()`, lambdas provide a concise way to specify the sorting or filtering criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Higher-Order Functions**: In functions that take other functions as arguments, like `map()` or `reduce()`, lambdas offer a convenient way to provide the required functionality inline.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Event Handlers**: In GUI or event-driven programming, lambdas are used for small callback functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Functional Programming**: Lambdas support a functional style of programming, allowing for operations on lists, streams, and other structures in a concise way.\n",
        "\n",
        "While useful for simplicity, lambdas in Python are limited to single expressions and cannot contain complex logic or multiple statements, which is by design to encourage readability."
