        "##Solution:\n",
        "To deep clone a singly linked list where each node has an additional \"random\" pointer pointing to any node in the list, we need to consider both the `next` and `random` pointers for each node. The cloned list should maintain the same structure and random connections as the original list.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can approach this problem in three phases:\n",
        "1. **Iterate through the original list and clone each node:** For each node, create a cloned node and insert it right next to the original node in the list. This way, each original node `N` will be followed by its clone `N'`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Copy the random pointers:** For each original node `N`, its `random` pointer will be pointing to some node `R`. The corresponding cloned node `N'` should point to `R'`, which is the clone of `R` and is located next to `R` in the modified list.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Restore the original list and extract the cloned list:** Separate the intertwined list of original and cloned nodes back into two individual lists, restoring the original list and extracting the cloned list.\n",
