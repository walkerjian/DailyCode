        "\n",
        "The expected number of rolls to reach the success state can be calculated using the expected value formula for Markov chains. For both games, the expected number of rolls $E$ to move from State 0 to State 2 can be calculated by setting up equations based on the transitions and solving them.\n",

        "#### For Game 2:\n",
        "\n",
        "The equations would be similarly set up, with the difference in the transition from State 1 due to the different success condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon correcting the calculations and equations for both games, we find that the theoretical expected values for both Game 1 (rolling a five followed by a six) and Game 2 (rolling a five followed by another five) are both 42 rolls.\n",
        "\n",
        "This result contradicts the simulation results we obtained earlier, which suggested that Game 1 had a lower expected value compared to Game 2. The discrepancy arises from a mistake in the simulation's interpretation or in the theoretical model's assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The correct interpretation is that the theoretical approach assumes a Markov process with specific transition probabilities between states. For both games, considering every roll as an independent event with a restart of the state after each non-target sequence, the expectation aligns at 42 due to the symmetry of the probabilities involved in transitioning from one state to the next until the success condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this theoretical result suggests an equal expected cost for both games, assuming ideal conditions and perfect mathematical modeling. The discrepancy with the simulation could be due to the stochastic nature of the simulations, where large numbers of trials approximate but do not exactly match the theoretical expectation due to randomness. The earlier simulation results might have slightly deviated from the theoretical expectations due to the inherent variance in simulated outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In light of the theoretical analysis, Alice should consider that, theoretically, there is no difference in the expected cost between the two games. The choice between them could then be based on other factors, such as personal preference or the potential for variance in outcomes from the theoretical expectation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The independence of each die roll and the identical probabilities of rolling any specific number on a fair six-sided die. Each outcome (1 through 6) has an equal probability of $1/6$ regardless of the previous roll, which is a fundamental property of independent events in probability theory.\n",
        "\n",
        "For both games, considering the objective is to roll a specific sequence (a five followed by a six for Game 1, and a five followed by another five for Game 2), the misunderstanding might stem from how these sequences are identified and the transition states involved. However, the error in my previous explanation was in the incorrect handling and explanation of the calculation process rather than in the understanding of the probability theory.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we're looking at sequences of outcomes, the key is to understand that reaching the first part of the sequence (rolling the first five) resets the conditions for achieving the second part of the sequence (rolling the next specific number, either a five or a six). The mistake in the simulation approach or the theoretical analysis might suggest a difference where there shouldn't be one, given the equal probability of rolling any specific number after the first five is rolled.\n",
        "\n",
        "To clarify:\n",
        "- **Each roll is independent**, and the chance of rolling a five or a six on any given roll is indeed $1/6$.\n",
        "- **The expected time to hit either sequence should theoretically be identical**, because after hitting the first five, the probability of rolling a specific number (either five or six) next is $1/6$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, theoretically, both games should have the same expected number of rolls to completion because the condition after achieving the first five does not change the independent probability of rolling a five or a six next.\n",
        "\n",
        "The expected number of rolls to achieve either a five followed by a six or a five followed by another five, considering the independence and equal probability of each roll, should indeed be the same due to the nature of independent probabilistic events in each game.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure the `simulate_game` function accurately reflects the independence of each die roll and correctly calculates the expected number of rolls for each game, we need to make sure it does not introduce any bias or incorrect assumptions into the simulation. Given the equal probability of rolling any number on a die, the expected number of rolls to achieve either \"5 followed by 6\" or \"5 followed by another 5\" should theoretically be the same.\n",

        "### Independent Events and Sequences in Dice Rolls\n",
        "\n",
        "When simulating or theorizing about sequences of dice rolls, each roll is indeed an independent event. This means the outcome of one roll does not affect the outcomes of subsequent rolls. Given this, the probability of rolling any specific number (1 through 6) on a fair six-sided die is always $1/6$.\n",

This is true for any single roll following the initial 5. However, the overall process to achieve these specific sequences involves more than just considering these probabilities in isolation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Theoretical Oversight\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial expectation that both games should have identical expected values might overlook the subtleties of how sequences are generated over multiple rolls. Specifically:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reset Conditions**: Each game effectively \"resets\" after a 5 is rolled but not followed by the target number. This reset affects how sequences accumulate over time.\n",
        "2. **Sequence Initiation**: The requirement to start each sequence with a 5 adds complexity, as rolling a 5 itself is a 1 in 6 chance, influencing the buildup to the stopping condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Possible Misinterpretations\n",
        "\n",
        "A misinterpretation may arise from simplifying the sequence generation process into too few states or not accounting for the \"memoryless\" property of each roll. While the probability of rolling a 5 then a 6 seems intuitively similar to rolling a 5 then another 5, the simulation's differing outcomes suggest a nuanced difference in how these sequences come to be.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the restrictions on accessing detailed mathematical explanations, we're left with a high-level understanding that both the independence of events and the specific sequences being targeted can influence the expected values in subtle ways. The discrepancy in simulation outcomes could prompt a deeper dive into probability theory and sequence analysis to uncover nuanced differences between seemingly similar conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the simulations and theoretical expectations continue to diverge, it could be valuable to examine the assumptions and methodologies more closely, potentially revealing overlooked aspects of sequence generation and stopping conditions in probabilistic models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your line of questioning and the example provided shed light on a crucial aspect of understanding expected values in sequences of probabilistic events, especially in the context of rolling dice. The intuition and mathematical reasoning outlined help clarify why the expected number of rolls to get two specific consecutive numbers (like a 5 followed by a 6) is different from the expected number of rolls to get two identical consecutive numbers (like a 6 followed by another 6).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Insights from the Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Non-symmetric Nature of Sequences**: The process of achieving two specific but different consecutive numbers (e.g., 5 followed by 6) incorporates a possibility not present when aiming for two identical consecutive numbers (e.g., 6 followed by 6). If you roll a 5 and then something other than a 6, there's a chance that this \"something\" is another 5, which can potentially lead to completing the sequence on the next roll. This is not the case when you're looking for two 6s; rolling a non-6 after a 6 offers no such shortcut or potential acceleration towards completing the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Different Paths to Success**: The paths to achieving sequences like 5-6 versus 6-6 differ in terms of their progression and how setbacks (rolling the wrong number) affect the distance to the goal. Rolling a 5 followed by a non-6 doesn't set you as far back in your quest for a 5-6 sequence as rolling a 6 followed by a non-6 does when aiming for two 6s.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Reset Conditions**: When aiming for two consecutive 5s, every roll of 5 potentially starts the sequence anew, which is not the case when waiting for a 5 followed by a 6. After rolling the first 5 in Game 2, rolling another number (except 5) does not maintain or advance the state towards the goal, effectively resetting the sequence more definitively.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Continuation Probability**: In Game 1, after rolling a 5, any next roll concludes the attempt for that sequence—either achieving it with a 6 or starting over without a 5. However, in Game 2, rolling a 5 allows for a continuation towards the target without immediate resolution. This subtle difference impacts the expected number of rolls due to how sequences are extended or concluded.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Overlap and Extension**: Game 2’s target sequence (5 followed by another 5) has an overlap potential not present in Game 1. When you roll a 5 but not the subsequent 5, the sequence resets, but each 5 roll has the potential to be the start of a new sequence. This overlap does not help in reducing the number of rolls because it does not contribute to the immediate success of the sequence but rather extends the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Independence of Events**: The core principle that each dice roll is independent and has a fixed probability (1/6 for each outcome) highlights that the difference in expected values is not about the probabilities of individual events but about how those events contribute to achieving the target sequence under the rules of each game.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "The intuitive expectation that the scenarios would have similar expected values overlooks the importance of sequence structure and how specific outcomes affect the continuation or conclusion of a sequence. The \"5 followed by a 6\" sequence is structurally more straightforward in its resolution per attempt, leading to a lower expected number of rolls compared to the \"5 followed by another 5\" sequence, where the nature of the sequence and the potential for overlap slightly increase the complexity and, consequently, the expected number of rolls.\n",
