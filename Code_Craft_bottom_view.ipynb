        "The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right the node will be when the tree is printed out.\n",

        "More rigorously, we can define it as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "The horizontal distance of the root is 0.\n",
        "The horizontal distance of a left child is hd(parent) - 1.\n",
        "The horizontal distance of a right child is hd(parent) + 1.\n",
        "For example, for the following tree, hd(1) = -2, and hd(6) = 0.\n",
        "```\n",

        "##Solution:\n",
        "To approach this task, we first need to understand the problem and then devise a solution that can be implemented, tested, and documented. Let's break down the task into smaller steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding the Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Definition of Horizontal Distance (HD):**\n",
        "   - The horizontal distance of the root node is 0.\n",
        "   - For any node, the HD of its left child is the HD of the parent minus 1.\n",
        "   - For any node, the HD of its right child is the HD of the parent plus 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Bottom View of a Binary Tree:**\n",
        "   - The bottom view of the binary tree consists of the nodes that are visible when the tree is viewed from the bottom.\n",
        "   - For each horizontal distance, only the lowest node is part of the bottom view.\n",
        "   - If there are two nodes at the same horizontal distance and depth, either of them is acceptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Solution Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Traversal Method:**\n",
        "   - Use a level order traversal (BFS - Breadth-First Search) to traverse the tree.\n",
        "   - While traversing, store the horizontal distance and the corresponding node value.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Structures:**\n",
        "   - A queue for BFS traversal.\n",
        "   - A map or dictionary to store node values with their horizontal distances.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Algorithm:**\n",
        "   - Start with the root node, with a horizontal distance of 0.\n",
        "   - In each step of BFS, for a node, update the map with its horizontal distance and value.\n",
        "   - After the traversal, extract the values from the map, which represent the bottom view.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Handling Duplicates:**\n",
        "   - If a horizontal distance is already present in the map, update it with the current node's value since we are looking for the lowest node at each horizontal distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write a function that implements the above approach.\n",
        "- Use a tree node class/structure for the binary tree representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "- Test the function with various cases, including:\n",
        "  - The given example tree.\n",
        "  - A completely unbalanced tree.\n",
        "  - A tree with only one node.\n",
        "  - A tree where two nodes at the same horizontal distance have different depths.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Documentation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Document the function with appropriate comments.\n",
        "- Explain the logic used in the function.\n",
        "- Include the test cases and the outcomes of each.\n"
